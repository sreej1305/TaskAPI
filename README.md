# TaskAPI

A high-performance, production-ready AI full-stack web application designed for scalability and security. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of a modern RESTful API architecture integrated with a sleek, responsive frontend.

## Project Overview

TaskAPI is built to handle complex task management and authentication flows with ease. Leveraging a powerful tech stack, it provides a robust foundation for building data-driven applications that require secure user access and efficient data processing.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Authentication**: Implements secure, JWT-based authentication combined with industry-standard password hashing using Argon2.
- **Scalable REST API**: A fully-featured API supporting comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, built with modularity in mind.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Role-based permissions ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources and administrative tools.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: A beautiful, glassmorphic UI built with React 18 and TailwindCSS, featuring smooth animations and responsive layouts.
- **Robust Backend**: Powered by Hono and deployed on globally distributed infrastructure for maximum performance and reliability.
- **Automated Deployment**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for seamless continuous deployment (CI/CD) to GitHub Pages.

## Technical Architecture

The project follows a modern monorepo-style structure, separating concerns between the core API logic, the web interface, and shared utilities.

- **Frontend**: React, React Router (v7), Lucide Icons, Framer Motion.
- **Backend & Routing**: Hono, Node.js.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon Serverless).
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design tokens.
